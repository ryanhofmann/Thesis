We present visible and near-IR photometry and spectra of the type IIn supernova PSN J13522411. The light curve, though poorly sampled, indicates a peak near M = -17, followed by a slow decline. Spectra show strong hydrogen and helium emission that peaks ~200 d after discovery, with a P-Cygni profile that becomes more absorptive as time progresses. We estimate the CSM has a radius of ~90 AU and was ejected ~12 yr before the explosion. From the light curve, we estimate the total emitted energy to be ~10^50 erg. Further details of the explosion will be determined as time allows.
