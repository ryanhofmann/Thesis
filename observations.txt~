Discovery

PSN J13522 was discovered on three 40-s survey images taken by Xing Gao in Xingming Observatory with an unfiltered CCD on a Celestron C14 Schmidt-Cassegrain telescope. The object first appeared on Jan. 09.9, and was confirmed on Jan. 14.9; nothing was visible in images taken on Jan. 07 (limiting mag 19.5).


SLOTIS photometry

After discovery of PSN J13522, the field was added to the queue of the robotic Super-LOTIS 24-inch telescope (SLOTIS, Williams et al. 2008) on Kitt Peak for multifilter (B, V, R, and I) follow-up observations. Images were automatically calibrated using a custom pipeline by Peter Milne, and aperture photometry was performed manually. The photometry is summarized in Table 1, and an image of the SN field is presented in Figure 1.


UKIRT JHK photometry

All photometric data were collected using the UK Infrared Telescope's (UKIRT) WFCAM instrument (). The 'seeing', estimated from the full width at half-maximum intensity (FWHM) of stars on the CCD frame, varied between ~3-5 arcsec. Aperture photometry was performed manually, and the results are summarized in Table 2.
