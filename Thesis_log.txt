Log begun 20 October

Progress up to this point:
  Plotted 4 MMT spectra, calibrated, velocity plots
  Obtained 10 sets of BVRI images from SuperLotis
    Plotted all images in grids
    Some I-band images had bad fringing, fixed
      Still need to obtain fixed 150505 image
  Obtained 3 sets of HJK images from UKIRT

Current tasks:
  Do aperture photometry on images, obtain light curve
  Compile plots and tables

Today summary:
  Began familiarizing with apphot
  Obtained fixed 150505 image
  Began SuperLotis photometry
