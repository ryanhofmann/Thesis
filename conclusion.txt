We obtained photometry and spectra of PSN J13522411 covering the early and later portions of the SN's decline. By integrating the light curve, we estimate the total radiated energy at ~10^50 erg. From the spectral data, we infer an age for the CSM of less than 12 years. We also infer from the velocity of the stellar wind that the progenitor was likely a red or yellow supergiant. Due to time constraints, we have not yet completed our analysis of this SN. In the coming weeks, we plan to determine the mass and distribution of the CSM and the total energy of the explosion.
