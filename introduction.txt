Understanding the explosive deaths of massive stars as supernovae is an important area of astrophysical research, as it is through this process that heavy elements are formed and dispersed into the interstellar medium. One of the more interesting aspects of these phenomena, and one that is still not well understood, is how supernovae interact with their environments. A striking example of this interaction is the class SNe IIn, which have narrow emission lines and slowly declining light curves (Filippenko 1997).

Most of the peculiar features of SNe IIn can be explained by a shell of dense circumstellar material ejected from the star before it exploded. Initially, intense UV- and X-ray radiation from the explosion photoionize the slow-moving CSM, producing narrow-line emission with a Lorentzian profile. Later, the rapidly expanding shock collides with the CSM, causing broad emission with a line profile that depends on the distribution of the CSM.

In this paper, we present visual and near-IR photometry and spectroscopy of PSN J13522411 from discovery up to ~450 d afterward. PSN J13522411 was discovered by Zhangwei Jin and Xing Gao on 2015 Jan. 14.9 in three unfiltered images of NGC 5337. The reported apparent magnitude was 16.9, which we assume to be equivalent to the R magnitude, but is more likely to be an upper limit. No source was visible in images taken on Jan. 07 (limiting mag 19.5). It was classified as having a type IIn spectrum on 2015 Jan. 16.9 by Jujia Zhang and Xiaofeng Wang. At a redshift of z = 0.007007 (2165 km/s), this corresponds to a distance of 36.39 Mpc (m - M = 32.8 mag), with a Milky Way line-of-sight extinction Av = 0.038 mag and reddening E(B - V) = 0.013 mag. PSN J13522411 resides in the outer disk of NGC 5337, at a projected separation of ~18 arcsec (~3 kpc) from the host galaxy's nucleus. Our observations are presented in Section 2, and the light curve and spectral evolution are analysed in Section 3. Section 4 provides a summary of our work.
